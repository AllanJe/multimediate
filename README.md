# multimediate
This package is based on the work presented in A. JÃ©rolon et al., "Causal mediation analysis in presence of multiple mediators uncausally related" (https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ijb-2019-0088/html).

The work allowing multiple mediation analyzes with a survival outcome was largely developed with Arce Domingo. This work is presented in Domingo-Relloso et al., "Causal mediation for uncausally related mediators in the context of survival analysis" (link available soon). 


Examples of use and supported models by our package are shown in vignettes/multimediate.html .
